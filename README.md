# Pong_GameExe-64-
Pong game Functionality Created Using C++ and SDL 

It uses the standard runtime GameObject Model and not the Tool time model.
Game is created from scratch from opening window, setting up renderer, Collisions, and Grabing inputs.

IT IS NOT A FINISHED GAME SO DON'T CRITICISE.
I my probably not going to work on this game in future, its just to showcase the Approach, 
to create a game using only C++.

Give it a star. 
And i can think of sharing the source code in future, depending on how many stars are there.
